                <p>
                    The name "Skardu" is believed to be derived from the Balti word meaning "a lowland between two high places."[5] The two referenced "high places" are Shigar city, and the high-altitude Satpara Lake[5] Local people might tend to write the name as སྐར་དོ་ according to how they pronounce it.

In the course of the history of Balti, bilabial sound /m/ as a prefix has been lost, and the vowel /o/ has turned into /u/, the same as many other dialects of Tibetan.In the course of the history of Balti, bilabial sound /m/ as a prefix has been lost, and the vowel /o/ has turned into /u/, the same as many other dialects of Tibetan.
